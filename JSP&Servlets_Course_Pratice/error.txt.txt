10)
error:The requested resource [/S22L10-Update_User_Operation_Part2/$%7BpageContext.request.contextPath%7D/site] is not available


sol:(how I solved): I guess the issue was with connector jar being not connected properly with tomcat I checked it with contextPath() that error was thrown then i used ${contextPath} as soon as i added maven dependecies in deployment assembly it after updating maven project it started working.

scenario and reason explanation: Required jars are not copied to WEB-INF/lib
Tomcat runtime classpath becomes inconsistent
JSP engine may partially work
EL behaves strangely
You see ${pageContext.request.contextPath} printed literally
